# Future Work

Items planned for future implementation. See also [implementation-guide.md](implementation-guide.md) for current status.

## Immediate Priorities

### 1. Integrate LoRa with Transport (Hardware Testing Required)

✅ **Interface adapter implemented** - See `src/lora/iface.rs`.

The `LoRaInterface` implements reticulum's Interface trait and bridges the radio with transport channels. Remaining work:
1. Test on actual ESP32 hardware with LILYGO T3-S3 board
2. Verify SPI and GPIO pin assignments
3. Validate LoRa TX/RX through the transport layer

### 2. BLE Mesh Interface (BLOCKER)

BLE fragmentation (`src/ble/fragmentation.rs`) is complete. Need to:
1. Create GATT service for Reticulum packets (separate from WiFi config)
2. Implement peer discovery and connection management
3. Bridge GATT RX/TX with transport channels

### 3. Hardware Testing

Flash to actual ESP32 hardware and verify:
- WiFi connection
- Testnet connectivity
- Stats endpoint accessibility
- Identity persistence across reboots

## BLE Configuration Expansion

The BLE GATT service (`src/config/ble_service.rs`) currently only configures WiFi credentials. Future extensions:

### Planned Configuration Options

| Setting | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| WiFi credentials | SSID and password | Done |
| Testnet server | Which testnet entry point to use | High |
| Announce filtering | Whether gateway filters internet→mesh announces (see [scalable-routing-proposal.md](scalable-routing-proposal.md)) | High |
| LoRa region | EU868, US915, etc. | Medium |
| DHT participation | Whether to join routing DHT (future) | Low |

### Implementation Notes

The BLE configuration service (`src/config/ble_service.rs`) uses a simple command-response protocol. Extensions should:

1. Add new command types to `ConfigCommand` enum in `src/config/wifi.rs`
2. Handle new commands in the BLE service
3. Store configuration in NVS (like WiFi credentials)

### Protocol Extension

Current implementation uses string-based commands via separate BLE characteristics:
- SSID characteristic: write network name
- Password characteristic: write password
- Command characteristic: write "connect" | "disconnect" | "clear"
- Status characteristic: read current status

Proposed additions (new characteristics or command extensions):
- Testnet server: "dublin" | "frankfurt" | custom host:port
- Announce filtering: "filter_announces:true" | "filter_announces:false"
- LoRa region: "region:EU868" | "region:US915" | etc.
- Full config read: JSON response with all settings

## Routing DHT Integration

See [scalable-routing-proposal.md](scalable-routing-proposal.md) for details on the DHT-based routing proposal.

When implemented, the BLE configuration should allow:
- Enabling/disabling DHT participation
- Configuring DHT bootstrap nodes
- Setting local mesh identifier

## Stats HTTP Endpoint

✅ **Implemented** - See `src/network/stats_server.rs`. Available at `http://localhost:8080/stats`.

## Interrupt-Driven Radio

The LoRa radio driver currently uses polling. Switching to DIO1 interrupt would improve power efficiency. See TODO in `src/lora/radio.rs:138`.
